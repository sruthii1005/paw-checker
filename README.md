The core of our project is a conversational AI system (chat box) that uses Ollama-hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate academic content dynamically. The user enters a prompt into the chat box interface, and the AI responds with a fully structured academic response â€” such as an introduction, abstract, or entire report section.
